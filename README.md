Some code I wrote YEARS ago for looking at files within the Nintendo DS games Hotel Dusk and Last Window.

It was originally part of something else called GameTools (can't recall if I ever made public). In March 2023 parts was hastily converted to .NET 6 and WPF to upload here. The main thing tested was Last Window's BRA animation files.

Regarding the images there's no buttons in the application to save in a usable format, but I'm sure you're smart enough to get lost in my horrible code and work out where to turn the Bitmaps into something useful.

# Example of usage
Drop a .pack file from Last Window into the bottom section of the app.
Look in the directory that contains the app for a GT-LastWindow folder.
Look inside there for a .bra file and drop that into the bottom section of the app.
You'll get a window that shows the animation on repeat.
